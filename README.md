TXST: 3358 Data Structures and Algorithms-Assignment 2.
Grade: 95% (Points lost on functions running out of bounds)

Assignment Description:
You are to provide the implementation for a second specification/design for the new data type described in Assignment 1. You are to use a dynamic (run-time), resizable array (instead of a compile-time, fixed-sized array) in the internal representation of the data type. This design removes the upper-bound limitation (with respect to the number of distinct values that can be accommodated) associated with the compile-time, fixed-sized array version.
